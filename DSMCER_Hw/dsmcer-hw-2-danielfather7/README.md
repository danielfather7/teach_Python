## Homework 2 is due Wed Jan 18 at 8 am


### Description and purpose 

The purpose of HW2 is to give you practice with matplotlib and molecular visualization. I'd like you to be able to make some composite images (e.g., a 6x6 panel graph) and learn more about customizing representation of 2D data (e.g., countour drawing).  

A secondary goal is to give you a basic level of familiarity (mostly via self-learning) of Avogradro as you may need some experience with molecular and materials visualization. 

### Files contained in this skeleton HW repository 

* README.me this file 
* HW2-SKEL.ipynb 
* ALA2fes.dat 
* HCEPDB_100K.csv 

### Instructions 

More details are in the Jupyter notebook for HW2. Follow through the notebook and complete all your work there. When you are done, check back in your work. I will check out your completed work and grade it and return to you via check-in when your grade is complete (at the bottom of this notebook).  

Note that I must be able to execute all cells in the notebook starting from top to bottom. I will not "clear all output" from your notebook and then execute it all in order to make sure the notebook works. 

#### Part 1: Data Visualization 

* This has two parts - composite image and surface plot 

#### Part 2: Molecular visualization 

* You will use Avogradro to draw a molecule and create a nice visualization, then insert it into a markdown cell 
### Grading 

See cues in my skeleton notebook so you can get some information about what I am looking for on each section 

|  Part |  Earned | Possible | Notes  |  
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Composite image  | 40  |  40 |   |   |
| Contour/surface plot | 30  | 30  |   |   |
| Molecular visualization | 30   | 30  |   | 
|  Other |   |   |   e.g., late penalty |
| Total grade | 100|100  | excellent job! | 


### A note about comments

Like Dave explained - comments in python (using # in a code cell - or just adding a markdown cell) is critical so I can follow your work. You can't really over-comment things. 

### A Note about collaboration 

My expectation is that everything you type in a Python notebook is your own work.  Any instances of "copy-paste" from the web or another person's notebook should be clearly cited. Of course you may look at examples but it is my strong preference that you refrain from copy-paste and type everything in. There is a learning reason for this, which I am happy to discuss in office hours or on slack.

I will follow UW academic misconduct policy for any suspected instances of cheating on HW or projects. Any confirmed instance of cheating results in a zero on a HW assignment. Any 2nd confirmed instance of cheating results in a zero for the entire course grade.
