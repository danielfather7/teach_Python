### Instructions 


* Check out this python notebook (DSM-CER HW1 skel) from GitHub classroom (if you are reading this, you probably did it). If you had a friend give you the python notebook, stop now and figure out how to get the correct starter code from GitHub classroom.

In the appropriate cell below, add the correct <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">link to the paper</a> so that we can find it. 
* If you cannot find a paper you want to read you can look for papers related to Materials Genome Initative, The Materials Project, Harvard Clean Energy Project, The Open Quantum Materials Database, or references from Part 1.  
	* _If you still can't find a paper, talk to us on Slack or come to office hours_
		 * **_If you still can't find a paper, I am out of suggestions_**
* Write a brief (200 words or fewer) summary of the paper, making sure to note the methods that were used as well as how the authors addressed one or more data-related challenges
