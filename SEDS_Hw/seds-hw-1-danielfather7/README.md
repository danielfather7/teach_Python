Homework #1 from SEDS


### Due Jan. 17, 2017 at 8AM


### Assignment
* Create your own ``setup.sh`` like we had in class to download the Harvard Clean Energy Project Database zip file and unzip it.
* Create a new Jupyter notebook.  Use ``pandas`` to load the Harvard Clean Energy Project Database into a data frame.
* Perform a simple data exploration.  You don't have to discover something new, but try to justify your explorations with comments in Markdown in the notebook.  I expect a minimum of 5 operations, transformations, etc. on the data and at least one matplotlib figure in the notebook.
* Modify this README.md to include instructions on how to run the ``setup.sh`` and what it does, what to expect as a user.  Put this under the 'Usage and more information' section.
* Commit the script, the notebook and your changed README.md to GitHub using the classroom link.


### Usage and more informaiton

#### Instructions
* 1.  Download  ``setup.sh``.
* 2.  Open  terminal, type in ``cd ~/Downloads/``(default downloading path) or ``cd [the path where you put setup.sh]`` to change  the directory.
* 3.  Type in ``bash setup.sh``, and it will start to download the file and then unzip. Afther you see ``finish`` in your terminal, the work is done.
* 4.  You will see a new folder named ``HCEPDB``, and there will be a ``.csv`` file in it.


### Grading rubric
5/5 - nice work!  I like how you highlighted your discovery in red.  PS, your instructions don't talk about how to open the notebook.  Don't forget that next time!
