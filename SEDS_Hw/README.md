# Software Engineering for Molecular Data Scientists
### In SEDS students will learn the following skills:
- Developing software in a way that it can be used by others, including documentation, installing packages, automating setup, and running computational studies.
- Creating technical specifications for what a program should do (its use cases) and how this is accomplished (software design).
- Creating, updating, and sharing a project using version control (specifically GitHub) for collaborative software development.
- Programming using the Python scientific stack, including numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.
- Developing unit tests that validate important aspects of the project implementation, and, more broadly, using test-driven development to build software.
- Searching, evaluating, and integrating into a project an externally developed Python packages as well as creating your own Python packages.
